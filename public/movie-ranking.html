<h1>Celena's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>I think these are some of the best movies I've ever seen and I will take no criticism.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Interstellar</h3>
<p>I just saw this movie for the first time a couple weeks ago. I may have cried for days. It was simply one of the most amazing pieces of cinema I have ever witnessed and I would love to see this movie many more time, when I'm emotionally prepared for it.</p>
<br />
<h3>2. Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>I mean, it's perfect. It's ridiculous. It's heartfelt. It's all of the things. It is... everything. Everywhere. All at once, one might say. I want an everythig bagel.</p>
<br />
<h3>3. Idk, Jumanji? The original one.</h3>
<p>I always used to say this is my favorite movie. The Robin Williams one, not The Rock. It was one of my favorites as a kid, I don't know if I would still say it's my favorite as an adult but it was always my go-to answer.</p>
<br />
<h3>4. Elf</h3>
<p>I'm only putting this at the end since it's Christmas-specific but Elf is hands down one of my favorites. I will watch it at least 5 times every Christmas. I know most of the script by heart. I'm that annoying person who will say the lines along with the movie. I will randomly shout out SANTAAAAAAA!! I KNOW HIM!!</p>
